    <center><h3>A cricket field or cricket oval is a large grass field on which the game of cricket is played.<br> Although generally oval in shape, there is a wide variety within this: perfect circles, elongated ovals, rounded rectangles, or irregular shapes with little or no symmetry â€“ but they will have smooth boundaries without sharp corners, almost without exception.</h3></center>
